# Homework03_PasswordGenerator

Intended in this project was an introduction to javascript programming syntax and logic, as well as an introduction to the use of functions in modular programming to simplify scripts. Fully-formatted HTML and CSS files were given which produced a "Password Generator". Upon clicking the "generate password" button, the user was to be prompted with questions on password length and character criteria. After providing valid answers, the page would generate an appropriate random password. The meat of the project was to code the function which would take the user's input and provide such a random password.
